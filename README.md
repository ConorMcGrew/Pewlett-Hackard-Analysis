# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 

Now that we have gathered information on the retiring individuals, we have been asked to organize the retiring individuals by titles and identify any who may be eligible for a mentorship program. 

## Results

- The vast majority of retirement eligible employees are the Senior positions, namely Senior Engineer and Senior Staff.
- The lower/entry level positions have significantly fewer people eligible for retirement.
- More than 1/3 of the total workforce (90398 / 240124) are eligible for retirement.

- A total of 1549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program.
- 720 of those eligible for mentorship are in "Senior" level positions. 

## Summary 

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

  - 90398 total roles will need to be filled, which is more than 1/3 of the total workforce. Perhaps allowing higher level positions (which compose the majority of the "silver tsunami") to go through phased retirement will lessen the potential impact. 

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  
  - Only 1549 employees, of the 90398 who may retire, are eligible for the mentorship program. If Pewlett-Hackard only replaced the retiring individuals one-to-one, that would mean one mentor had to cover 50 new employees. So there probably are not enough mentors. Perhaps revising the mentorship program to include employees who have worked x number of years (say 5 or more) at their current position, instead of by age only. 

- Suggested queries: sort the retirement by titles further by department, so that management can see where they need to start hiring first. Also, looking at the results, many of the mid/entry level positions have significantly fewer employees eligible for retirement and almost all of the senior level positions are eligible for retirement. We should create a queary to look at the employees by title who are unlikely to retire soon, and see how long they have worked at their current level. Pewlett-Hackard may want to start a mentorship chain where the senior employees looking to retire mentor the mid-level employees and the mid-level employees who have worked at their current positions for a while mentor the new-hires. That way they can look internally for most of the replacements.
